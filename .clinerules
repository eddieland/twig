This is a Rust workspace project. Use `cargo build -p <crate-name>` for workspace operations.

Always use nextest for testing with `cargo nextest run`, never use `cargo test`.

Use `make` targets for common tasks like `make test`, `make fmt`, `make check`.

Files in the docs/ directory are auto-generated and should not be edited manually.

### Output Helper Usage

**`twig_core::output` helpers** (always visible to user):
- `print_success()` for successful operations
- `print_error()` for failures that block the operation
- `print_warning()` for issues that don't block the operation
- `print_info()` for important information (use sparingly)

**`tracing` macros** (controlled by `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv` flags):
- `tracing::info!()` for progress messages (visible with `-v`)
- `tracing::debug!()` for detailed debugging info (visible with `-vv`)
- `tracing::trace!()` for verbose technical details (visible with `-vvv`)
