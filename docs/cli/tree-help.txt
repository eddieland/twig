Display local branches in a tree-like view based on user-defined dependencies.

This command shows branch relationships that you have explicitly defined using
the 'twig branch depend' command. It also displays associated Jira issues and
GitHub PRs. Branches without defined dependencies or root status will be shown
as orphaned branches. Use 'twig branch depend' to create relationships and
'twig branch root add' to designate root branches.
