Intelligently switch to branches based on various inputs.

This command can switch branches based on:
• Jira issue key (e.g., PROJ-123)
• Jira issue URL
• GitHub PR ID (e.g., 12345 or PR#12345)
• GitHub PR URL
• Branch name

The command will automatically detect the input type and find the
corresponding branch. By default, missing branches will be created
automatically. Use --no-create to disable this behavior.

Usage: twig switch [OPTIONS] <INPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>
          Jira issue, GitHub PR, or branch name
          
          Can be any of the following: • Jira issue key (PROJ-123) • Jira issue URL (https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123) • GitHub PR ID (12345 or PR#12345) • GitHub PR URL (https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123) • Branch name (feature/my-branch)

Options:
      --no-create
          Don't create branch if it doesn't exist
          
          Disable the default behavior of creating branches when they don't exist. By default, twig switch will create missing branches. Use this flag to only switch to existing branches.

  -p, --parent [<PARENT>]
          Set parent dependency for the new branch
          
          Specify a parent branch to create a dependency relationship. Values can be: • 'current' (default if flag used without value): Use current branch • A branch name: Use the specified branch • A Jira issue key (e.g., PROJ-123): Use branch associated with Jira issue • 'none': Don't set any parent (use default root)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
