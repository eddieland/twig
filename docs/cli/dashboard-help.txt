Show a comprehensive dashboard of local branches, PRs, and issues.

This command displays a unified view of your development context,
including local branches, associated pull requests, and related Jira issues.
It helps you keep track of your work across different systems.

By default, only local branches are shown. Use --include-remote to include remote branches.

Use --no-github or --no-jira to disable GitHub or Jira API requests respectively.
Use --simple for a basic view that shows only branches without making any API requests.
