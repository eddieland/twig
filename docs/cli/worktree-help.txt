Manage Git worktrees for efficient multi-branch development.

Worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate
directories, all connected to the same repository. This enables working on
different features or fixes concurrently without stashing or committing
incomplete work.

Usage: twig worktree <COMMAND>

Commands:
  clean   Clean up stale worktrees
  create  Create a new worktree for a branch
  list    List all worktrees for a repository

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
