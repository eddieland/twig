Scan local branches and automatically detect and link them to their corresponding
Jira issues and GitHub PRs.

For GitHub PRs, this command:
• First searches GitHub's API for pull requests matching the branch name
• Falls back to detecting patterns in branch names if API is unavailable

For Jira issues, it looks for patterns in branch names like:
• PROJ-123/feature-name, feature/PROJ-123-description

GitHub PR branch naming patterns (fallback detection):
• pr-123-description, github-pr-123, pull-123, pr/123

It will automatically create associations for detected patterns and report
any branches that couldn't be linked.

Usage: twig sync [OPTIONS]

  -r, --repo <PATH>

      --dry-run

          Update existing associations that differ from detected patterns
