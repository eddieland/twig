## Purpose

Intelligently switch to branches by name, Jira issue key, GitHub PR number/URL, or interactively. Optionally creates new
branches with automatic parent dependency linking. Serves as the primary entry point for starting work on an issue or
PR.

**CLI surface:** `twig switch` (alias `sw`), flags: `--root`, `--no-create`, `-p/--parent` **Crates:** `twig-core`
(git/switch, state), `twig-cli` (switch command module)
