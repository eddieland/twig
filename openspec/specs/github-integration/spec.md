# GitHub Integration

## Purpose

Interact with GitHub pull requests from the terminal. Link PRs to branches, list PRs with filtering, view PR status with
review and CI check details, open PRs in the browser, and verify GitHub authentication. Credentials sourced from
~/.netrc.

**CLI surface:** `twig github check`, `twig github checks`, `twig github open`, `twig github pr link/list/status`
**Crates:** `twig-gh` (client, endpoints, models), `twig-core` (github utils, state), `twig-cli` (github command module)

## Requirements
