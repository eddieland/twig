# Branch Tree

## Purpose

Visualize the branch dependency graph as a formatted tree/table in the terminal. Displays branch names, linked Jira
issues, GitHub PRs, divergence counts, and orphan annotations in a readable columnar layout with ANSI color support.

**CLI surface:** `twig tree` (alias `t`), flags: `--max-depth`, `--no-color`, `-r` **Crates:** `twig-core` (graph,
renderer, tree algorithms), `twig-cli` (tree command module)
