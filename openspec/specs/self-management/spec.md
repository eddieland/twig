# Self Management

## Purpose

Twig maintenance utilities: update twig and its plugins to the latest release from GitHub, run system diagnostics to
verify the environment, generate shell completions for bash/zsh/fish/powershell, and discover installed plugins.

**CLI surface:** `twig self update` (alias `upgrade`), `twig self diagnose` (alias `diag`), `twig self completion`,
`twig self plugins` **Crates:** `twig-cli` (self_cmd module)
