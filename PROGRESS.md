# Twig Implementation Progress

This file tracks our progress through the implementation plan for the Twig project, as well as lessons learned along the way.

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Iteration 0: Project Setup & CI/CD
- [x] Set up Rust project structure with clap
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and releases
- [x] Set up basic project structure and dependencies
- [x] Install development tools
- [x] Create development documentation

## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup
- Setting up CI/CD early provides immediate feedback on code quality
- Using GitHub Actions for both Ubuntu and macOS ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Establishing coding standards (rustfmt, clippy) from the start maintains code quality

### Development Process
- (Add lessons as they are learned during implementation)

### Technical Insights
- (Add technical insights as they are discovered)

### Challenges Overcome
- (Document challenges and their solutions)
