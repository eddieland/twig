## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup
- Setting up CI/CD early provides immediate feedback on code quality
- Using GitHub Actions for both Ubuntu and macOS ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Establishing coding standards (rustfmt, clippy) from the start maintains code quality

### Development Process
- Implementing command aliases in clap is straightforward with the `.alias()` method
- Breaking functionality into modules helps maintain clean separation of concerns
- Using anyhow for error handling provides good context for errors

### Technical Insights
- The directories crate simplifies finding the right locations for config and data files
- Using serde for serialization/deserialization makes state management straightforward
- The git2 crate provides a comprehensive API for git operations
- Repository-local state in `.twig/state.json` allows for portable metadata that travels with the repo
- Hybrid approach (global registry + local state) provides flexibility and clean separation of concerns

### Challenges Overcome
- Handling repository paths consistently required careful canonicalization
- Detecting the current git repository required traversing parent directories
- Managing the repository registry required careful error handling
- Working with Git worktrees required understanding the StringArray API for proper iteration
- Ensuring `.twig/` is added to `.gitignore` required careful file handling

### Output Formatting
- Using the `colored` crate provides a simple way to add color to terminal output
- Centralizing formatting logic in utility functions ensures consistency
- Color-coding different types of messages (success, error, warning, info) improves readability
- Consistent formatting makes the CLI tool feel more professional and user-friendly

### Code Quality Management
- Addressing dead code warnings is important for CI/CD pipeline success
- Rather than removing potentially useful code, find ways to use it in the codebase
- Methods like `repo_state_dir` and `repo_state_path` were integrated into existing functionality
- Keep utility methods that might be useful for future iterations, but ensure they're used

### Parallel Execution
- Using tokio for parallel execution significantly improves performance for batch operations
- Small delays between task spawns (100ms) prevents overwhelming the system
- Collecting results and providing summary statistics gives users clear feedback
- Error handling in async contexts requires careful consideration
- Unused variables in match patterns should be prefixed with underscore

### Stale Branch Detection
- Git's branch API provides access to commit timestamps for detecting staleness
- Using chrono for date/time formatting improves readability of timestamps
- Configurable thresholds (--days parameter) provide flexibility for different workflows
- Parallel processing of multiple repositories makes stale branch detection efficient

### Command Execution
- Using std::process::Command allows executing arbitrary commands in repositories
- Capturing and displaying command output provides transparency to users
- Success/failure reporting with colored output improves user experience
- Summary statistics help users understand the results of batch operations

### Jira Integration
- Using the reqwest crate provides a simple way to interact with the Jira API
- Storing credentials in .netrc allows for secure authentication without hardcoding
- The Jira API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for issue management
- Branch naming conventions based on issue keys and summaries create clear associations
- Storing branch-issue associations in repository-local state allows for portable metadata
- Transition IDs can be looked up by name for a more user-friendly experience

### GitHub Integration
- Using the same .netrc credential system for GitHub provides consistency with Jira
- The GitHub API requires specific headers like User-Agent and Accept for proper operation
- Basic authentication with GitHub API uses the same pattern as Jira, simplifying implementation
- Displaying user information provides immediate feedback on successful authentication

### GitHub PR Integration
- The GitHub API provides comprehensive endpoints for PR management
- Storing PR-branch associations in repository-local state allows for easy status checking
- Grouping reviews by user and showing the latest review status provides a clear overview
- Color-coding check statuses and review states improves readability
- Regular expressions are useful for extracting information from GitHub URLs
- The BranchIssue structure can be reused for both Jira issues and GitHub PRs
- Supporting both PR URLs and PR IDs provides flexibility for users

### Error Handling Best Practices
- Always include the underlying error message when reporting errors to users
- Extract specific error messages from API responses rather than showing generic parsing errors
- When parsing fails, try to extract meaningful information from the response before falling back to generic errors
- For user input validation errors, include the specific input that failed validation in the error message
- Limit the size of large error payloads to avoid overwhelming users while still providing useful context
- Use `anyhow::Context` to add high-level context to low-level errors
- Consistent error formatting improves user experience and makes debugging easier

### Enhanced Credential Management
- Interactive setup wizards provide a much better user experience than manual file editing
- Input validation should happen at multiple stages: empty checks, format validation, and API validation
- Graceful handling of partial setup allows users to configure only the services they need
- Credential validation during setup prevents invalid credentials from being stored
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting tips reduce support burden and improve user success rates
- Secure file permissions (0o600) for .netrc files are critical for credential security
- The .netrc format's simplicity makes it easy to parse and update programmatically
- Supporting both create and update operations for .netrc entries provides flexibility for existing users
