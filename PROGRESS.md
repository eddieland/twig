# Twig Implementation Progress

This file tracks our progress through the implementation plan for the Twig project, as well as lessons learned along the way.

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Iteration 0: Project Setup & CI/CD
- [x] Set up Rust project structure with clap
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and releases
- [x] Set up basic project structure and dependencies
- [x] Install development tools
- [x] Create development documentation

### ✅ Iteration 1: Minimal Viable Tool
- [x] Implement `twig init` to create config directories
- [x] Create repository registry with add/remove/list
- [x] Add `git fetch --all` command
- [x] Implement `--repo` flag and CWD detection
- [x] Add command aliases (g, ls, rm)
- [x] Create consistent formatting utilities

### ✅ Iteration 2: Worktree Support
- [x] Add worktree creation with sensible defaults
- [x] Implement worktree listing and cleanup
- [x] Add `.twig/` directory creation and .gitignore management
- [x] Store worktree metadata in repo-local state
- [x] Add command aliases (wt, new, ls)

### ✅ Iteration 3: Batch Operations
- [x] Create command execution engine with tokio
- [x] Add progress reporting for batch operations
- [x] Implement error handling and summary reporting
- [x] Add stale branch detection with alias

### ✅ Iteration 4: Jira Integration - Authentication
- [x] Parse .netrc for Atlassian credentials
- [x] Create Jira API client with authentication
- [x] Implement credential validation
- [x] Add helpful error messages for auth failures
- [x] Add jira command aliases (j, i, show, trans, br, new)

### ✅ Iteration 5: Jira Integration - Workflow
- [x] Add branch creation from Jira issues
- [x] Implement branch naming convention
- [x] Store issue-branch associations in .twig/state.json
- [x] Add issue state transitions

## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup
- Setting up CI/CD early provides immediate feedback on code quality
- Using GitHub Actions for both Ubuntu and macOS ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Establishing coding standards (rustfmt, clippy) from the start maintains code quality

### Development Process
- Implementing command aliases in clap is straightforward with the `.alias()` method
- Breaking functionality into modules helps maintain clean separation of concerns
- Using anyhow for error handling provides good context for errors

### Technical Insights
- The directories crate simplifies finding the right locations for config and data files
- Using serde for serialization/deserialization makes state management straightforward
- The git2 crate provides a comprehensive API for git operations
- Repository-local state in `.twig/state.json` allows for portable metadata that travels with the repo
- Hybrid approach (global registry + local state) provides flexibility and clean separation of concerns

### Challenges Overcome
- Handling repository paths consistently required careful canonicalization
- Detecting the current git repository required traversing parent directories
- Managing the repository registry required careful error handling
- Working with Git worktrees required understanding the StringArray API for proper iteration
- Ensuring `.twig/` is added to `.gitignore` required careful file handling

### Output Formatting
- Using the `colored` crate provides a simple way to add color to terminal output
- Centralizing formatting logic in utility functions ensures consistency
- Color-coding different types of messages (success, error, warning, info) improves readability
- Consistent formatting makes the CLI tool feel more professional and user-friendly

### Code Quality Management
- Addressing dead code warnings is important for CI/CD pipeline success
- Rather than removing potentially useful code, find ways to use it in the codebase
- Methods like `repo_state_dir` and `repo_state_path` were integrated into existing functionality
- Keep utility methods that might be useful for future iterations, but ensure they're used

### Parallel Execution
- Using tokio for parallel execution significantly improves performance for batch operations
- Small delays between task spawns (100ms) prevents overwhelming the system
- Collecting results and providing summary statistics gives users clear feedback
- Error handling in async contexts requires careful consideration
- Unused variables in match patterns should be prefixed with underscore

### Stale Branch Detection
- Git's branch API provides access to commit timestamps for detecting staleness
- Using chrono for date/time formatting improves readability of timestamps
- Configurable thresholds (--days parameter) provide flexibility for different workflows
- Parallel processing of multiple repositories makes stale branch detection efficient

### Command Execution
- Using std::process::Command allows executing arbitrary commands in repositories
- Capturing and displaying command output provides transparency to users
- Success/failure reporting with colored output improves user experience
- Summary statistics help users understand the results of batch operations

### Jira Integration
- Using the reqwest crate provides a simple way to interact with the Jira API
- Storing credentials in .netrc allows for secure authentication without hardcoding
- The Jira API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for issue management
- Branch naming conventions based on issue keys and summaries create clear associations
- Storing branch-issue associations in repository-local state allows for portable metadata
- Transition IDs can be looked up by name for a more user-friendly experience
